# AsyncHTTPClient

This class mediator can be used to invoke a backend service inside the class mediator using java.net.http package (introduced in Java 11). To engage the class mediator you need  to use a custom mediation policy as below and then use the respond mediator. Make sure to change the backend URL as you need.

<ul>
<li>connectionTimeout: the time to establish the connection with the remote host</li>
<li>socketTimeout: the time waiting for data â€“ after establishing the connection; maximum time of inactivity between two data packets
</li>
</ul>

```<sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="custom_policy">
   <class name="org.custom.CustomHttpClient">
     <property name="connectionTimeout" value="30"/>
     <property name="socketTimeout" value="60"/>
   </class>
   <respond/>
</sequence>
